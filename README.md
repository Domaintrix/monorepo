# Domaintrix

**Domaintrix** is a modular framework designed to streamline modern .NET application architecture using DDD, CQRS, Event-Driven Design, and Clean Architecture/Hexagonal Architecture principles.

This monorepo hosts the full development of Domaintrix while the project is in its **beta phase**. It centralizes all core packages and sample implementations to accelerate iteration and integration testing.

> After the first stable release, packages will be split into individual repositories and published independently to NuGet.

## ðŸ”§ Projects

This repository includes:

- **Core Packages** â€“ foundational building blocks (e.g., Identity, Mediator, Eventing)
- **Adapters & Integrations** â€“ example implementations using technologies like Auth0, Kafka, etc.
- **Sample Applications** â€“ reference projects demonstrating best practices with Domaintrix

Each subproject will include its own `README.md` with specific usage instructions and documentation.
